## Introduction to Game Development

game idea -> game concept -> initial documentation and final game idea \
Prototype -> pitch -> demo and/vertical slice \
Testing & iterating -> Final Game

Our team has to design, code and produce a full serious game using Godot. \
Small but polished game, following rules of game design and dev \
The deliverable has to be a pleasing serious game, and be as bug free and as feature complete as possible.

### Theme: Climate Change

subject nuclear power, effects of the raise of the ocean atmospheric temperature, mobility options, wildfires

## Lesson 6: Level Design

Level Design is applied and specialized game design. It turns abstract rules of the game into specific playable experiences by unifying gameplay. It comes with its own methodologies and goals. \
Level design is what creates the environment and spaces of the game, players will explore, traverse, and play.

Level design is hiding and fixing technical and design problems. Camera flipping for example, when the camera bounces between two objects. Decorations around corners can easily fix this issue.

The term level can be both specific and vague, depending on the game. In certain cases level can mean anything from mission and area to world and quest. It can also refer to an environment where play happens.

### Level Designer

A level designer acts as an architect of virtual worlds. The express game design both through and in virtual space, and ensure that players are provided with challenges, puzzles and opportunities to play.

the level designer has to guide player movement, highlights narrative beats, set up engaging combat scenarios and create puzzles.

The level designer will combine and arrange the work of the whole team in a cohesive functioning whole. They will combine textures, geometries, sprites and mechanics, musics, ambient sounds, place enemies, hazards, spawn points.

The level designer is responsible for making the vision of the game design become a reality.

The level design team is responsible for placing and expressing the following:

- lighting
- characters
- enemies
- information
- story
- world building
- game design
- core mechanics

The fundamental, general goals of good level design has to:

- teach how the game is played, and what its mechanics are,
- make the game entertaining,
- correctly define and gauge the difficulty & flow of the game,
- appropriately reward or even punish players,
- contribute to player immersion,
- be varied and reward exploration or experimentation.
- provide the required audiovisual experience, and offer quality visual composition
- support and realize the goals of game design.

### Practical Rules

Form follows function (functional requirements, usability, etc...) \
Experience is key (delight, horror, elation, etc...) \
Metrics are important \
Play testing is mandatory, All games and level design should be iterative \
Always ask ourselves who is the level intended for. How do players actually see a level \
Rhythm \
Gradual introduction of game elements and difficulty \
Spaces must be interesting and provide challenges \
Gather references (geology, urbanism, and architecture), information

### Flow & Difficulty

Flow is the foundation of every successful video games experience. It applies to effectively all genres \
"if flow is broken, the other parts of the game experience fall apart"

The goldilocks zone of flow is different for every player. It needs to be designed for a specific skill level. \
In several cases elastic challenges are provided. Those are challenges that provide different levels of success (and failure).

Multiple degrees of failure; barely miss a jump and die, be forced to retry, or simply grab the edge and pull up (continue) \
Difficulty options are another solution. As they are dynamic difficulty adjustments.

The three levels of Virtua Racing offer different difficulty settings, starting locations, and overall driving / gaming experiences \
Track width and competing for race position versus road space. \
Elastic challenge is provided for expert players, by using manual gear shifting to maximize their advantage.

MARIO'S 1-1 LEVEL teaches us that certain bricks are breakable, how the screen scrolls, what mushrooms do, how enemies are killed, how jumping works, etc...

#### Doom example

what does game design define:

- FPS
- Frantic action
- Armor, HP
- Weapons variety
- Single & Multiplayer
- Bonuses
- Monsters variety

John Romero's level design rules:

- Always change floor height when changing floor texture
- Use border textures between different wall segments and doorways
- Be strict about texture alignment
- Use contrast between light and dark areas, and cramped and open areas
- If the player can see outside, they should somehow be able to get there
- Be strict about having several secret areas on each level
- Make levels flow so that the players revisit areas and better understand 3D spaces
- Create several easily recognizable landmarks for easier navigation

Those 8 rules are not enough to create a good level.

### Types of level design

Depending on game genre \
Depending on the camera \
Depending on level size and game structure \
Depending on a specific level's purpose \
Digital & analog level design

### Teaching, testing, Rewarding

Humans as well as many animals have a biological tendency to play. It's through play that we acquire crucial skills (in safe environment)
By playing, we are rewarded with pleasure and knowledge. it has been argued that acquiring knowledge is in itself pleasurable.

Games can potentially teach us all sorts of things but they must absolutely be able to teach us their rules; how we play them.
Then they test how well we understood what is meant to understand
Finally they reward us for the efforts.

Good level design makes certain the player...

#### Teaching

If a game cannot teach its rules, it cannot be played. \
Fundamentals aside, games also teach tactics, better approaches, strategies, path-finding, game logic, spatial patterns, skills uses, and anything else that ,might be needed.

Teaching should generally be followed by a chance of safe trying out the newfound knowledge or skill.

We can teach traditionally through tutorials, manuals, wikis, videos. \
We can teach the Montessori way by allowing experimentation \
We can teach through examples and observation

##### Designing Tutorial Level

The many functions of a tutorial / first level:

- the art of the arrival!
- Set the tone, introduce the theme
- Teaching basic controls and types of obstacles or challenges
- Allowing the practice of key abilities
- Testing, teaching, rewarding in the purest form.
- Subtle hidden tutorials and controlled spaces
- The direct versus the Montessori-type method
- Continuous in-game teaching
- Visual, textual and auditory learning systems

#### Testing

Test the ability of the player with increasing difficulty levels. \

#### Rewarding

- Praise
- Points
- Prolonged play
- Gateway
- Spectacle
- Expression
- Powers
- Resources
- Status
- Completion
  
But also: achievements, loot, souvenir, bonus materials, un-lockable content, even more praise, customization options and surprises.
The positive reinforcement of rewards makes the feel even more rewarding.

Remember that the main way to generate dopamine motivation is by creating the anticipation of rewards. When we feel we are close to a reward, our brain releases dopamine to increase our motivation to pursue this goal.

Remember that superimposed reward schedules work as well

Remember that rewarding activities the player already wants to undertake make them even more satisfying

But also remember that, sometimes, rewarding something already satisfying can take a way from the experience

### The Visuals of Game Design

A beautiful level is not enough, a good level has to be functional, legible and remain interesting both aesthetically and gameplay-wise. it must also be very prudent and economical in the amount of visual assets it uses. \
The legibility of a level and the information it conveys can change during a game

Complex graphics make noise. structuring a game's visual hierarchy can be important. \
Players can only absorb a certain number of signals at a time. Further signals added past this limit can't be processed by the player and becomes noise.

In a visual hierarchy, everything is displayed at once, but more important pieces of information are made more visible so that people notice them.

The level designer, the game designer and the visual artist will co-decide on the visual symbols of gameplay mechanics and suggest pleasing and effective solutions. they will define the visual language that the game will use.
Examples: LA Noire and Dark Souls

A game must establish a metaphor vocabulary that indicates which elements are simulated mechanically. It must remain consistent with this vocabulary.

Level artwork, Geometry and level design are also tasked with:

- guiding players
- engaging in environmental storytelling
- filling-in segments devoid of gameplay
- contributing to world building
- triggering specific emotions
- supporting and emphasizing gameplay
- evoking the appropriate atmosphere
- focus players' attention

### Visual Composition

Aims to improve views and scenes, it arranges and organizes scene elements. \
It guides our gaze to points of interest and curial information. It creates aesthetically pleasing images. \
It uses symmetries, the rule of thirds, guiding lines.

### Traditional Level Design Pipeline

**Pre-production**: Information gathering, research, references, team discussion, level design document, sketches and rough block-out. \
**Production**: Level block-out, iteration on block-out, adding gameplay elements, more iteration and testing art and audio synching \
**Iteration**: Final art & audio pass, lighting pass, review.

### 3D level design considerations

- Verticality and depth,
- Thoroughly check lines of sight
- Think in 3D - realize that 3D spatial awareness is a skill that can challenge many and that 3D mental maps are demanding
- Guiding through and navigating in #d spaces must be simpler than in 2D ones,
- Ai design must take 3d space into account

### A brand new level

We begin with a concept, an idea, inspiration can be found in games, paintings, literature, movies...

What's the purpose of the particular level? Its aesthetics? What's the intended experience?

### Level Characteristics

What kind of space is the level taking place in?

How big is the level? How much time is required for it to be fully explored or beaten?

What paths will players use to traverse the space?

What are its aesthetic? its architecture?

What is the story the level narrates

What are the goals? What challenges will they face?
