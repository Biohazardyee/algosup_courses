Simple Hello World program

```c++
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

## Essential Data Types

The void type describes an empty set of values.
    - No variable of type void can be specified.
    - The void type is used primarily to declare functions that return no values or to declare generic pointers to untyped or arbitrarily typed date.

The boolean type can have values true or false.
    - The size of the bool type is implementation-specific

The int type is the default basic integer type. It can represent all of the whole numbers over an implementation-specific range.

A signed integer representation is one that can hold both positive and negative values.

A size modifier specifies the width in bits of the integer representation used.

The language supports short, long, and long long modifiers.

A short type must be at least 16bits wide. A long type must be at least 32 bits wide. A long long type must be at least 64bits wide.

## Strings in C++

Same as in C
    - characters array with a twist

Dedicated data type: string
    - To use it, we must include an additional header the <string> library

The <string> library offers many functionalities.
