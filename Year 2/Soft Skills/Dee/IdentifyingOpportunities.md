## The values I value the most

- Love
- Openness
- Humor

### Positive and Negative Behaviors Driven by These Values

#### Positive

- **Love:** Caring for others, fostering healthy and non-toxic relationships, I want love to be primary (family first).
- **Openness:** Being receptive to others' opinions, beliefs, and perspectives, which helps in understanding different viewpoints.
- **Humor:** Creating a light-hearted atmosphere that brings joy, making work environments and social interactions more enjoyable and likable.

#### Negative

- **Love:** Can cause pain if feelings are one-sided or lead to being blinded by love, overlooking important issues.
- **Openness:** May result in feeling vulnerable or left out when your own feelings are not equally acknowledged.
- **Humor:** Risks not being taken seriously if humor dominates, and sometimes it can be misinterpreted or offend others.

They have to be balanced, not too much, but enough. These points are important to me, but I keep in mind that if they are unbalanced, this can lead to issue.

## Personal Vision

- A personal vision is a clear picture of your desired future.
- It should be **meaningful**, **realistic**, and **easy to understand**.
- It must also be **inspirational**—appealing to your imagination and aligning with your core motives and aspirations.

### How I want potential employers, colleagues, and partners to see me

I want to be seen as a relaxed, easygoing person—gentle, trustworthy, and someone who brings humor and a light-hearted atmosphere to the workplace.

### What will make me special

I would love to be known as a skilled guitar player, but above all, I want to be recognized for my kindness and gentleness. These qualities matter to me more than any specific talent.

### What I want my family and friends to think of me

I hope my family and friends see me as someone caring, loving husband, gentle, and docile—always willing to help and there for them when they need support.

### What reputation I wish to have among people I may not know personally

### Personal Vision Statement

In the future, I want to be known as a kind, gentle, trustworthy, and hardworking person—someone who brings a light-hearted, supportive presence to both personal and professional relationships. I aim to build a fulfilling life through meaningful work, service in the Gendarmerie, wise investments, and by nurturing my passion for guitar and human connection. I aspire to be a loving husband, a reliable colleague, and a person who values purpose over profit.

## Discovering Opportunities

Effectuation - [Link explanation](https://blog.hubspot.fr/sales/effectuation#:~:text=L%27effectuation%20est%20une%20logique,avec%20exactitude%20dès%20ses%20débuts.)

- Start with what's available now
- Invest want you can afford to lose

Process of exploration

- Who I am / What I know
- WHat I can do → goals
- Who I know
- stakeholders / commitment
  - no commitment → dead end (dump bad idea)
  - new means → how will I do this
  - new goals
-

A change in environment changes what you know (e.g. lessons) and loops back to the beginning

This whole loop leads to new firms, products or markets

5 principles:

1. bird in hand

- start with what you have
- asked yourself what should I know
- who I know
- use the available resources
- zero

2. Affordable loss

- make a commitment
- find what you can lose
- focus on downside
- limit risks

3. Crazy quilt

- patchwork quilt
- partnership and networks
- seek funding
- co-create new markets with interested others
- build hive with bees

4. Lemonade

- sense and seize opportunities
- don't use what if
- transform problems into chances for growth
- more lemon, more lemonade

5. Pilot in the plane

- control vs predict
- focus on activities within control
- action result in desired outcomes
- don't predict the future: make your own

- designed for older people experiencing reduced mobility
- enable coordination and mobility
- increase autonomy
- amount of obstacles they might face avoided
- reaction time
- stability regarding long distance → balance

## Today's Conclusion

- When you are given the task to task somebody, don't do it yourself.
- Sometimes they do even better than what you've imagined
- trust your colleague, you will get sometimes surprised
- even if they don't deliver as you expected them to, it opens new possibilities
- sometime the best solution is the combination of ideas
- sometimes you have to build up and not build down

## Building Relationships

"The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them" - Hemingway

Trust holds relationship together. No matter the source of the relationship (love, friendship, colleague)

Do you directly trust someone, or do you not ?

1. People are open directly, until they get hit on the head
2. People won't trust you and will test you all along

If you always search for mistakes, it communicates no trust.
Rather, search for good things and mistakes. And feedback will be more appreciated.

TRUST = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Perceived Self Orientation

Credibility = perceived competence \
Reliability = Perceived consistency and dependability: delivering promises \
Intimacy = Perceived closeness and understanding

Perceived Self Orientation = Perceived personal gain motive

Sometimes people say the same thing as you with other words, you have to understand that they have the same pov as you. \
Things don't have to be said the way you think or say them.

### The 5 trust skills

- Listen

  - Do not argue or apply a fixed mindset
  - Empathetic, earning the right to be heard

- Partner

  - do not compete over ideas, maybe other people can add value to your idea, sometimes they are trying to improve it (keep in kind that sometimes they try to shoot you down, in that case, refuse it, but conquer your mind)
  - Give and take
  - Being in 'tune', know their needs, understand them

- Know yourself

  - You need to know yourself for others to trust you, it's at the center.

- Risk

  - Risks of trusting, the more you defend, the more people throw stones, they will stop eventually if you don't defend. WHen someone argues with you, they give you weapon to fight back with, so don't give them weapons in return.
  - Willingness to take risks because there's a solid relationship to fall back on
  - When the relationship is strong, you forgive more, so you are willing to take more risks and when it comes to conflicts, you know it can be fixed, because the relationship is strong
  - Negotiation doesn't have to take a lot of time when you trust each other

- Improvise
  - Flexibility (according to the needs of the people we are working with)
  - Thinking and responding quickly when the situation is not familiar
  - Some things you cannot control or predict will happen
  - Practice improvisation, your instinct will get better

You have to be like water, be flexible and hard to be trapped, be like bamboo, be strong and flexible at the same time. In Asia, they say that
bamboo (fiber) can be stronger than steel.

Lots of talking doesn't matter, the doing does, and the doing improves your credibility

### 4 elements of empathy

1. See their world
   1. put yourself in their shoes
2. Appreciate them as human beings
   1. don't judge them they are human after all
3. Communicate understanding
   1. verbal/non-verbal communication
   2. a smile can be enough (beware of cultural differences)
4. Understand feelings

### Trust creation process - ELFEC

   2. state problems and hypotheses
   3. Take personal risks to explore sensitive issue in depth "So the issue is..."

5. Commit

Thibaud:

- had a great feeling as well

Would hire Camille for the junior web developer job, on a common decision, Camille wasn't expecting for the senior job, and from what he said, the interviewer was aiming for the same.

## Continuous Learning

Everything around us is interconnected and that every decision or action we take has consequences for ourselves and others.

### Critical thinking DSRP

Distinctions: We make distinctions between ideas, objects, things...

Systems: We organize things into part-whole groupings...

Relationships: We make connections between and among things...

Perspectives: We take different perspectives on and from things...

Learning and resilience begin with mindset, with a growth mindset, you'll find a solution faster, you'll get out of the situation in an easier way.

### Ignorance Management

If there's something you don't know try not to cover it up, thrive to know it as soon as possible. Get things done basically.

When you're angry, count up to 20 before opening your mouth, keep control of yourself and understand that your answer will have consequences.

You need to bring it out and up, systemic response. Don't throw stones back.

Steve Jobs, despite having a fairly rude and disrespectful question, kept composure by taking his time, cooling down and applying a systemic response.

We have to learn on our feet, and not being blinded by angriness is a must-do but being agile in the way we learn is as important.

### Learning Agility

- Individual attributes related to Learning Agility:
  - Goal orientation
  - Cognitive ability - the ability of making connections, apply the programming approach when it comes to relationships, what goes with what
  - Openness to experience - not be defensive, you shouldn't be to be told twice

When people offer to help us, we have to be grateful. And not feel as if it is competition

- Learning Agility

  - Speed
  - Flexibility

- Outcomes
  - Fast learning across situations
  - Positive performances changes over time

   1. Vans that bring elderly there
   2. Collect complaints of people
   3. 180,000 euros
   4. Solution to make an app that allows people to make their rent

Report:

Total: 1,692M€ → 108K€ spare

2 mains pb: Housing + Education (all the others are related or due to them)

1st of all: Focus education, but the propositions weren't good enough, except the new teachers, we also considered reducing crimes by changing lights (but due to the fact it won't be done this year, we decided to postponed it, then, if extra budget it will be spared for them next year)

2nd: Housing, we realized that some actions might be better if paired (the manager and the housing survey)
So we decided to take those 2 (1M€ + 300K€)

To help elder people and reduce everyone's need to move from A to B, we added the vans moving across the city to pay rent (+180K€)

And finally, to help women victim of domestic violence, we're adding the center helping the victims (+140K)

The consultant wasn't a good idea as the consultant wouldn't bring a thing, those that know things are those that been working on the project for 10 years.

The decision you take reflects your values. 

We realized that all the problems in the city stem from education and homelessness, so our decisions focused mostly on fixing this issue
We tried focusing on education, but most of the solutions didn't work. Building a new primary school was not a good idea in a town with already 64 primary schools, even if one of them is bad. We also thought that it was stupid to invest in a television channel, as most young people are on social media and don't watch tv, and it's useless to teach stuff to the elderly, who are the main TV watchers.  But we did think that it was worth it to hire the new teachers to help with illiteracy, as it is not very expensive and helps treat the problem at the source for only 72,000€.
After that, we focused on housing. we couldn't afford to take the risk of spending the 1,800,000€ on a research and development project since we need to fix this town's issues soon, and housing is not the only one.
Also, the solution of one center in the center of the district is not viable, as we know that it's already difficult for people to move around, and there are 232,000 homeless people; if we add the battered women, it is not enough to only have one building. However, this town has a lot of elderly people, and a lack of education usually leads to mothers with a lot of children so doing the truck to help them pay rent was a good idea, it also helps with risking going out in a town with lots of vandals and lack of lights to see them coming since old people and children don't run fast enough to escape them.
At first, we thought the survey for housing stock was not a good idea, however, we realized that if we combined it with the manager, it would help a lot with the housing problem, as we would be able to allocate existing housing a lot more efficiently and figure out more solutions to make new housing since the solutions we had weren't viable. Digitising all the rent was a good idea, but it is far too expensive, and once again, it takes the whole budget and there is more than one issue to solve.
All of the proposition of the public services department were ignored as, the streets will be dirty as long as their are homeless people and drug addicts, the lights were a good idea but it takes too long and if we do nothing people will leave and the garbage disposal plant is too expensive and would be a lot more useful if we had more housing.
Creating two buildings for 1,700,000€ was not a good idea since it is too expensive and is only a bandage on the homelessness problem. and the drug rehabilitation center is not that useful unless kids are educated or have a job, so until this is a lot better, the drug rehab is not worthwhile. However, helping battered women was a good idea since they need help quickly, and it also makes good publicity.
In the end, all of our ideas combined are:
1,000,000€ for the survey,
300,000€ for the consultant,
140,000€ for the battered women,
180,000€ for the van helping to pay rent,
72,000€ for extra teachers,
1,692,000€ in total.
The rest will be allocated for new lighting for the next year.
