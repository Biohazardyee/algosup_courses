## The values I value the most

- Love
- Openness
- Humor

### Positive and Negative Behaviors Driven by These Values

#### Positive

- **Love:** Caring for others, fostering healthy and non-toxic relationships, I want love to be primary (family first).
- **Openness:** Being receptive to others' opinions, beliefs, and perspectives, which helps in understanding different viewpoints.
- **Humor:** Creating a light-hearted atmosphere that brings joy, making work environments and social interactions more enjoyable and likable.

#### Negative

- **Love:** Can cause pain if feelings are one-sided or lead to being blinded by love, overlooking important issues.
- **Openness:** May result in feeling vulnerable or left out when your own feelings are not equally acknowledged.
- **Humor:** Risks not being taken seriously if humor dominates, and sometimes it can be misinterpreted or offend others.

They have to be balanced, not too much, but enough. These points are important to me, but I keep in mind that if they are unbalanced, this can lead to issue.

## Personal Vision

- A personal vision is a clear picture of your desired future.
- It should be **meaningful**, **realistic**, and **easy to understand**.
- It must also be **inspirational**—appealing to your imagination and aligning with your core motives and aspirations.

### How I want potential employers, colleagues, and partners to see me

I want to be seen as a relaxed, easygoing person—gentle, trustworthy, and someone who brings humor and a light-hearted atmosphere to the workplace.

### How I intend to make money

I plan to earn a living through multiple paths:

- Working as a full-time employee
- Serving as a reservist in the Gendarmerie
- Investing in the stock market
- Invest in my bank account (interests)

### What will make me special

I would love to be known as a skilled guitar player, but above all, I want to be recognized for my kindness and gentleness. These qualities matter to me more than any specific talent.

### What I want my family and friends to think of me

I hope my family and friends see me as someone caring, loving husband, gentle, and docile—always willing to help and there for them when they need support.

### What reputation I wish to have among people I may not know personally

I want to be known as a hardworking, trustworthy, and gentle person, even by those who may not know me well.

### Personal Vision Statement

In the future, I want to be known as a kind, gentle, trustworthy, and hardworking person—someone who brings a light-hearted, supportive presence to both personal and professional relationships. I aim to build a fulfilling life through meaningful work, service in the Gendarmerie, wise investments, and by nurturing my passion for guitar and human connection. I aspire to be a loving husband, a reliable colleague, and a person who values purpose over profit.
