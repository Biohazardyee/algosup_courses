1. Finish enjoying your meal
2. Once done, gather all the dishes together
3. Throw the left-overs in the bin, or give it to the nearest homeless person 
4. Fill in the sink with warm water and some soap, until it bubbles
5. Put in your dishes

7. With the sponge, scrub the dish thoroughly, until it shines
8. Repeat step 7 for all of your dishes
9. Take a towel to dry everything up
