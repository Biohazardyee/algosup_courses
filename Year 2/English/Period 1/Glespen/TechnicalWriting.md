## Write a procedure for washing dishes

You’re eating your favorite meal but just found out you need to do the dishes later? Don’t worry we got you. 

1. Finish enjoying your meal
2. Once done, gather all the dishes together
3. Throw the left-overs in the bin, or give it to the nearest homeless person 
4. Fill in the sink with warm water and some soap, until it bubbles
5. Put in your dishes 
6. Grab a sponge, wet it and soap it
7. With the sponge, scrub the dish thoroughly, until it shines
8. Repeat step 7 for all of your dishes
9. Take a towel to dry everything up
10. Voila! 10 easy steps to wash your dishes

You now know how to wash your dishes safely, you can now repeat the whole process, everytime you eat or cook something succulent.

**Feedback:**

- too informal, too much unnecessary information.
- we’ve got your back.
- you’ve just found out.
- dish soap
- do a “this is what you need:” section
- grab -> take
- drying rack
- keep procedures down to 9 steps. unless if installation guide

**Other feedback:**
