### Internet Era

This brings us to the next point: the early 21st century, also known as the internet era.

The first major evolution in this period was in consoles. We saw the release of the PlayStation 2 in 2000, the Wii in 2004, and the Xbox 360 in 2005—consoles that defined our childhood. These systems introduced significant improvements in graphics, gameplay, and features, including built-in DVD players and hard drives, which transformed gaming into a more immersive and accessible experience.

The second key development was the rise of online gaming. Players were finally able to connect with others over the internet, leading to the creation and legacy of some of the most iconic video games ever, such as World of Warcraft and Counter-Strike. Initially, online gaming was limited to LAN (Local Area Network) connections, but as internet access became more widespread, players could connect globally through online servers, revolutionizing multiplayer gaming.

Lastly, the mobile gaming industry began to take shape. One of the first notable mobile games was Snake on the Nokia 3310, released in 2000. As technology advanced, mobile games evolved significantly, and with the launch of the iPhone in 2007, games like Angry Birds emerged, showcasing major improvements in graphics, sound, and gameplay. The difference in mobile gaming technology between 2000 and 2009 was staggering, setting the stage for the massive mobile gaming industry we see today.

### How AI enhanced and will enhance video games

New technologies such as AI have been used in video games since the 1980s, though they were more like algorithms than true artificial intelligence. Over the years, AI has evolved, particularly in the behavior of Non-Playable Characters (NPCs), enhancing both the gaming experience and immersion.

AI has also been used for procedural world generation, as seen in the famous video game No Man’s Sky. This technology allows for the creation of infinite, unique worlds every time a new game starts, making the possibilities virtually endless.

Another application of AI is in speedrunning, where it is used to create Tool-Assisted Speedruns (TAS). Programmers develop AI-driven algorithms that learn and optimize gameplay to complete games as fast as possible. This innovation has revolutionized the speedrunning community, pushing the limits of what was previously thought possible.

But what about the future of AI in gaming? One of the most exciting developments is AI-driven content generation. Video game companies are beginning to explore AI-generated narratives, allowing for dynamic storytelling where speech, text, and interactions adapt based on the player’s choices and playstyle.

Additionally, AI can enhance video game graphics through AI-powered upscaling tools, improving textures and resolution in older or lower-quality games. This technology is already being used in remastered editions and emulation to provide a more polished and immersive experience.
