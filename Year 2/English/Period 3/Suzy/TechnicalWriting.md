## Mentioned In Class

The following type of list dominate technical writing:

- Bulleted lists
- Numbered lists
- Embedded lists

Use a bulleted list for unordered items; use a numbered list for ordered items:

• If you rearrange the items in a bulleted list, the list's meaning does not change
• If you rearrange the items in a numbered list, the meaning of the list changes.

• Numbered procedures
• Complete sentences
• Imperative verb form
• Consistent sentence structures
• Capitalize the first word in each step
• Always use a phrase when you need to tell the customer where to start. The
rest of the time, start each sentence with a verb.
• Use a period after each step
• Limit a procedure to seven steps and preferably fewer.
• Use parallel structure
