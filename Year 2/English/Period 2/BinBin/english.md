How does the author description of the yellow headed blackbird create a vivid image to the reader.

The usage of two vivid colors—bold yellow head and bright blue sky—contrasts with the black body of the bird. This emphasizes the magnificent and vivid colors of the birds that stand out from the landscape.  The colors stand out despite the dark-feathered color of the bird. Moreover, the colors are well-described and precise, making it simple for the user to synthesize the image.

What is the significance of the author, distinguishing between his early bird memory and his earliest birding memory?

Dinesh is being prompted by his coworker to send a file, once again. Dinesh is petulant, as he has already sent the file 5 times. It is not a brain exercise to dig into the conversation.

His coworker stood there, as if he had something to pitch, in fact, he sat down, into thin air, revealing a mechanic tripod chair. He was extolled by the creation and restored the throne to his coworker, by sending him the file.

Thereafter, Dinesh took hold and focused on dissing his coworker with Gilfoyle, his friend. I found myself rather captivated upon discovering that it was a chatbot all along, making lines on the paper. It laid down enough pencil miles to trick Dinesh into thinking it was Gilfoyle.
